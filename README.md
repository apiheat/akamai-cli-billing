## Akamai CLI for Billing Center

The Billing Center API allows you to access your websiteâ€™s monthly usage over the Akamai network. Usage data is available for entire contracts, or for reporting groups, which may include CP codes from more than one contract.

Should you miss something we *gladly accept patches* :)

CLI uses custom [Akamai API client](https://github.com/apiheat/go-edgegrid)

## Configuration & Installation

### Credentials

Set up your credential files as described in the [authorization](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html) and [credentials](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Conf_Client.html) sections of the getting started guide on developer.akamai.com.

Tools expect proper format of sections in edgerc file which example is shown below

*NOTE:* Default file location is *~/.edgerc*

```
[default]
client_secret = XXXXXXXXXXXX
host = XXXXXXXXXXXX
access_token = XXXXXXXXXXXX
client_token = XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

In order to change section which is being actively used you can

* change it via `--config parameter` of the tool itself
* change it via env variable `export AKAMAI_EDGERC_CONFIG=/Users/jsmitsh/.edgerc`

In order to change section which is being actively used you can

* change it via `--section parameter` of the tool itself
* change it via env variable `export AKAMAI_EDGERC_SECTION=mycustomsection`

> *NOTE:* Make sure your API client do have appropriate scopes enabled
